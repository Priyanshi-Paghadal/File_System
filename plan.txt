### Plan:
1. **Review Current Functionality**: The current `index.js` file provides the following functionalities:
   - **Create Folder**: An endpoint to create a new folder in the `storage` directory.
   - **Create File**: An endpoint to create a new text file in the `storage` directory.
   - **List Contents**: An endpoint to list all files and folders in the `storage` directory.

2. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - **Add Error Handling**: Improve error handling for better user feedback.
   - **File Deletion Endpoint**: Consider adding an endpoint to delete files or folders.
   - **File Reading Endpoint**: Consider adding an endpoint to read the contents of a specific file.

3. **Dependent Files**: The changes will primarily affect the `index.js` file.

4. **Follow-up Steps**:
   - Implement the changes in the `index.js` file.
   - Test the new functionalities to ensure they work as expected.
